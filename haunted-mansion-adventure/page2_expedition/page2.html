	<p id="text">Up on Elmwood Hill sat an abandoned mansion believed to be haunted. The owner was said to be a wealthy, private, recluse of a man who suddenly fell ill. With only an estranged family and a few acquaintances, the man passed away quietly in the company of none. Leaving behind all his riches. The kids of East Granten believe his soul now haunts his former abode. Granting good fortune to those who succeed in swiping a souvenir from his mansion and cursing those who fail.<br><br>
	
	Like the many kids that came before you, you now stand before the haunted mansion of Elmwood Avenue.
